Chris: Hey Ike where you been? 
Ike: Health Center. 
Chris: What’s wrong? You get frostbite streaking the Colonnade?
Ike: What? No I just- I hooked up with this girl and the condom in my wallet got kind of warped...
Chris: (looks like “oh shit”) 
Ike: She’s on the pill, so we don’t have to worry about that, but I still want to make sure I didn’t catch anything.
Chris: Do you...feel anything? (motions around nether regions) 
Ike: Not yet, but I wanted to get tested to make sure. I got plans this weekend.
Chris: Dude you’d know if you had something, right? Or if the girl did? I mean, I can tell
Ike: What are you on? You can’t always just ‘tell’ 
Chris: Sure you can. My big told me; “if it’s bumpy or red, don’t get in bed.” Simple enough. 
Ike:  You can’t be serious. Even if you don’t have symptoms, you can still give it to someone. How would you feel if you accidentally gave me an STI? You need to go to the Health Center. 
Chris: I don’t want everyone to know if I have something. Which I don’t.
Ike: It’s confidential. No one’s gonna know. 
Chris: Fine.  
Ike: You should pick up some condoms while you’re there. They have all sorts of stuff; dental dams, lube…
Chris: The Health Center gives those away?
Ike: Yeah, they’re by the door and your RA should have some too. 
Chris: Great, then we’ll be totally covered. Do you think they have any extra large? 
Ike: Get real
